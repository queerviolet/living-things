          When the organizers asked me to do this talk, they said,
          "Weâ€™d really like an inspirational talk about your vision!"

          And, let me tell you, that is *exactly* what every speaker
          wants to hear. Or, at least it's exactly what I want to hear.
          That is really an excellent pitch, and so I said I would love to.

          And they said they'd love to hear it, and I said I'd talk about
          life and living systems and it would be very inspirational and
          everyone was just thrilled.

          So then I sat down to write it.

          And, when I write, I try to just... let it flow.

          we're on the cusp of something, and that something might very well be
          The End.

          And that's quite stressful.
