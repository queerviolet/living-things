          When the organizers asked me to do this talk, they said,
          "Weâ€™d really like an inspirational talk about your vision!"

          And, let me tell you, that is *exactly* what every speaker
          wants to hear. Or, at least it's exactly what I want to hear.
          That is really an excellent pitch, and so I said I would love to.

          And they said they'd love to hear it, and I said I'd talk about
          life and living systems and it would be very inspirational and
          everyone was just thrilled.

          So then I sat down to write it.

          And, when I write, I try to just... let it flow.

          But it's not really... I just think it's not quite the right direction.
          
          I think we can do better.

          And the world of now is... well, it's definitely going somewhere, you can
          say that much. Some very exciting things are happening. It feels like
          we're on the cusp of something, and that something might very well be
          The End.

          And that's quite stressful.

          So let's step away from the now, and go back.`
