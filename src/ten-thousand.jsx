    the clock mechanisms work. Precision-machined gears made of stainless steel, stone, and
    ceramics. Movements sealed in quartz, protected from dust and the elements.

    It's a fascinating project. A testament to optimism. Will it work?

    Maybe. None of the technology in the clock has been tested across
    the timespans involved. We think it'll work, but it obviously never has.

    Are cities physical things? Sortof questionable, isn‚Äôt it?
    They are things, certainly. If we were standing in space,
    looking down at the earth at night, and you pointed to a
    blob of light and asked, ‚Äúwhat is that thing?‚Äù The answer would be:
    a city. So cities are some kind of thing, and they have bodies,
    and perhaps that is enough.

    Certinly, we can even imagine sending a message with a city.
    
    A settlement with strict rules about which water sources are
    safe and which ones are forbidden. An order of monks tasked
    with guarding knowledge of what lies beneath and disseminating
    the sacred scripture, which says, in the main: do not dig.
    
    Would it work? Or would would we eventually grow too curious?
    When famine hits, would we come to believe that the priests
    are not guarding death, as they claim, but instead vast stores
    of food and riches? Would we kill them all, and eagerly crack
    open the earth to see what‚Äôs inside?

    It‚Äôs hard to say what will happen in ten thousand years. It‚Äôs
    a time horizon that stretches nearly all our engineering. To
    send a message to ten thousand years from now is to build a
    bridge that will span all those millennia, somehow, without
    support.

    Or the bridge has to be alive. It has to have roots‚Äîa support
    structure strong enough to maintain the message, dynamic and
    resilient enough to stay anchored across 10,000 years of the
    shifting landscape of the world‚Äôs resources.

    It doesn‚Äôt have to be a structure.

    It can just be a story.
